# stock_analysis
The purpose of this challege is to refactor the code and loop through all the data to determine weather we can analyze the stock market efficiently for Steve and his parents and come up with a result for their investment. 
## Stock Comparison 
We will be looking at the year 2017 and 2018 to compare stock preformance
### Year 2017

Looking at the data in 2017 and comparing it to the tickers, this year was very positive year for the companies in as a general. We can see the total daily volume rising and also geting a high turnover or returns with all but one company with ticker ( TEMP ) on the negetive side of things. 

### Year 2018

Looking at the data in 2018 and comparing it to the tickers, this year was not a positive year we see a lot of losses in the return with only two companies with tickers ( ENPH,RUN ) with positive returns or turnover. 

### Results 
When we were asked to look at Steves stock data manually, we saw the companies he invested in and the results he was getting on 2017 and 2018. For steve's parents they wanted to know how often DQ was traded in 2018 to get a rought idea for how often the stock gets traded. After this analysis and coding we found out that DAQO dropped over 63% in 2018. This was a finding that would help steve choose better stock for this parents. Based on this outcome, we looked at all the losses and gains in the year 2017 and 2018 and came to the conclusion that 2018 had been a bad year of investing for the steve and his parents with 2017 seeing a lot og growth. We can see how often the companies trade and when it is a good time to trade to make better trading decision for Steve. 

### Refactoring code
Advantages can be that after refactoring the code it becomes easierto understand and it becomes less complex. Disadvantages of code refactoring can be that sometimes it can take a long time and it becomes time consuming and you might get stuck in a situation with no answers. 
#### Application 
Pros : The main goal of code refactoring is to make it easy to enhance and maintain it in the future. It also helps in increasing the flexibility of code to add anything when or if there are things to edit in a project. Cons : In case something is wrong, you will have to waste much time in solving the problem and there is a chance that it may go wrong due to the complexity of the code itself.
